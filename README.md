A ping command is commonly used to check the availability and responsiveness of a device or server on a network. When you ping an IP address, you're sending a small packet of data (an ICMP echo request) to that address, and if the target is reachable, it sends back a response (an ICMP echo reply).

In Python, you can simulate the ping command to check if a device (specified by its IP address) is reachable over the network.

Using os Module to Ping

The os module in Python allows you to interact with the operating system, including running system commands such as ping. This method uses the system's built-in ping utility to check the reachability of an IP address.

What this code does:
It runs the ping command on the system (using os.system()), where:
-c 1 means send only 1 ping packet.
{target_ip} is the IP address you want to check.

The response code is checked:
A 0 response indicates that the ping was successful (the target is reachable).
A non-zero response indicates a failure (the target is unreachable).

Summary of What Ping Does:

Checks Network Connectivity: A ping sends a request to a specified IP address to check if it is reachable over the network.

Measures Round-Trip Time: It can also be used to measure the time it takes for a packet to travel to the target and back, which is known as latency.

Detects Unreachable Hosts: If no response is received from the target, it indicates the target is unreachable or there is a network issue (e.g., firewall blocking ping requests).

Error Handling: If the ping fails, it could be due to various reasons, such as the target being down, network configuration issues, or blocked ICMP requests.
